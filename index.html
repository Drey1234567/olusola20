    <h1>Postman Pat Story Treasury</h1>
    <h3>Postman Pat the Hilltop Hero</h3>
    <p>One morning,Pat had a job to do before he went to work.He climbed a ladder to get rid of the leaves that were blocking the gutter on the roof.</p>
    <p>"Thanks,Pat," said Sara. "I Know you dont like heights."</p>

    <p>Later on,Pat took some post to Thompson Ground.</p>
    <p>Bill was helping his dad herd some sheep into the trailer.</p>
    <p>"We're moving them up to the hills near Greendale Crag",said ALF."There's more grass for them there".</p>
    <p>Bill patted his pet sheep,Bessie."I wish Bessie could stay on the farm".he said,Bessie agreed!</p>
    <p><mark> "Baaaaaa!"</mark></p>
    <p>Pat gave Bill a lift to the railway station where Julian,Meera and Sara were waiting.Ajay was taking them all on a walk to Greendale Crag.</p>
    <p>Ajay followed is map."This way",he said."Through this gate and accross the field".</p>
    <p>Ajay closed the gate carefully,but it swung open again!</p>
    <p>Alf had put his sheep in the next field.Bessie and another sheep ran out through the gate.They wanted to go back to the farm!</p>
    <p>Pat was driving back to Greendale when he saw the sheep on the edge of the crag. "That's Bessie!" he said.</p>
    <p>"She shoudn't be up here!"</p>
    <p>Pat tried to move the sheep away from the cliff.But Bessie was scared and she ran off down a steep path.She got stuck on a tiny ledge!</p>
    <p>Ajay and children were sitting around a camp fire at the bottom of the crag when Bill heard, <mark> "Baaaaaa!"</mark></p>
    <p>"That's Bessie!" he said.Pat went to the edge of the cliff and shouted down.Bessie's stuck!" he said "Get help,Ajay!"</p>
    <p>Ajay found Amy in her jeep and told her about Bessie.</p>
    <p>Amy drove to the top of the crag.She put on a harness and tied her climbing rope to a tree.</p>
    <p>"Ready!" said Amy,and she swung out over the edge of the cliff.</p>
    <p>Down she went,<ol type="i">
        <li>down...</li>
        <li>down...</li>
        <li>down...</li>
    </ol></p>
    <br>
    <p>When she got to the ledge,Amy put a harness on Bessie.</p>
    <p><mark> "Baaa, baaa!"</mark> said Bessie.She was very pleased to see her.</p>
    <p>But when Amy started to climb down,the rope got stuck on a rock.Amy and Bessie swayed around in mid-air!</p>
    <p>"You'll have to climb down and free it,Pat!" said Amy.</p>
    <p>Pat gulped."Erm ... all right", he said. "Hold on, I'm coming!"</p>
    <p>Pat put on a harness and tied a rope around the tree. then he took a big, deep breath-and stepped over the edge of the cliff!</p>
    <p>Down he went,</p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>down...</li>
        <li>down...</li>
        <li><mark> down.</mark></li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Bill and the others watched from the bottom of the crag.</p>
    <p>"Your dad's really brave, julian", said Bill.</p>
    <p>"I Know", said Julian. "And he's scared of heights!"</p>
    <p>Pat pulled Amy's rope free and she climbed down with Bessie.</p>
    <p>Bill ws so pleased to see her that he gave her a big hug.</p>
    <p>Bessie was pleased to see Bill,too. "<mark> "Baaa, baaa, baaa!"</mark> she bleated.</p>
    <p>When Pat climbed down,Julian gave him an extra big hug.</p>
    <p>"I thought you were afraid of heights, Dad said. "I am",said pat. "But i had to rescue Amy and Bessie, didn't I?"</p>
    <p>Bill clapped and others joined in. "Three cheers for pat!" he said. <mark> "What a hero!"</mark></p>

    <h3>Postman Pat and the Greendale Knights.</h3>
    <p>One morning,Mrs Goggins had some parcels for Pat.</p>
    <p>"They're pllants",said Pat. "Sara's going out for the day,so I'm tidying up the garden as a surprise for her".</p>
    <br>
    <p>At Farge Cottage,Julian,Bill,Lucy and Meera were playing a game of Knights. Julian knelt down. "I know sir julian, Knights of Greendale", said Bill, proudly.</p>
    <p>"Can i be a knights?" asked Meera.</p>
    <p>"No", said Bill. "Girls can't be Knights".</p>
    <p>"O,yeah?" said Meera.</p>
    <p>"Yeah", said Bill. "They have to fight dragons and stuff.They have to be strong".</p>
    <br>
    <p>When Pat got home, he took some of the parcels out of his van.</p>
    <p>Lucy wanted to help.She grabbed a big parcel, but it was much too heavy for her.</p>
    <p>"I told you,girls can't be knights", said Bill. "You're not strong enough".</p>
    <p>"O,yes we are!" said Meera.</p>
    <br>
    <p>She grabbed a parcel.Meera wanted to show how strong she was.</p>
    <p>So did Bill! But they both tripped and fell over!</p>
    <p>"You'd better leave the parcels to me", said Pat.</p>
    <p>"Ok, Dad", said Julian. "Come on, we'll look for dragons!"</p>
    <p>"D-d-d-dragons?" said Lucy.</p>
    <p>"See,girls are scared of everything",said Bill.</p>
    <p>"Well I'm not!" said Meera.</p>
    <p>Just then, Lucy heard a loud noise.It made her jump.</p>
    <p>"It's a d-d-dragon!" she said. "It's Dad's tractor", said Bill. "Only a girl would be scared oa a tractor!"</p>
    <p>Alf unloaded the arbour he had brought for Pat. "You make it into a arch shape,plant around it,and they grow up the sides", Pat explained.</p>
    <p>Then Pat dug a new flower bed. The empty compost bags gave him an idea! He cut neck and armholes in one,and put it on Julian.</p>
    <p>"There you are", he said."Armour!"  Pat made armour for the others.Then he made visiors and shields from the plant boxes.Wooden spoons made good swords!</p>
    <p>"Now we can fight like real knights!" said Julian.</p>
    <p>"Take that!" said Meera.</p>
    <p>"Take that!" said Bill.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Please stop", said Lucy.</p>
    <p>"I dont like fighting!" Julian had no one to fight with!</p>
    <p>"Maybe Bill's right" he said.</p>
    <p>"Girls can't be knights".</p>
    <p>Meera and Bill got a bit carried away! "Look out!" said Pat.</p>
    <p>Too late! They crashed into the arbour and knocked it flat.  "I think that's enough fighting", said Pat. "Go and have a drink to cool down".</p>
    <p>There was a big suprise waiting for the Greendale Knights when they went back into the garden.Pat had made a castle out of the plant boxes.</p>
    <p>Bill,Meera and Julian went inside.They left Lucy outside to guard the castle.</p>
    <p>When Lucy saw smoke coming from behind the house she told the others.   "Is it a dragon?" asked Meera. "No,it's a scary knight!" said Bill.</p>
    <p>"Look,he's got a fire sword!"  "Hide" said Julian.</p>
    <p>Poor Lucy was on her own.She wanted to hide,but she was on guard. "I have to protect the castle", she said. "I must be brave". She picked up the water hose,turned it on,and fired it at the knight. But it wasn't a knight,it was Ted! He had come to fix the arbour with his blow torch! Splash! He was drenched!</p>
    <p>The knights came out of the castle. "You saved us, Lucy", said Julian. "Yes,you were really brave", said Bill.</p>
    <p>Julian asked Pat to knight Lucy.He touched her shoulders with a wooden spoon. "I knight you Lady Lucy Selby", he said. The Knights helped Pat to finish the garden. When Sara came home she could hardly believe her eyes! "Oh,it's lovely", she said. "Thank you, Pat!" "Don;t thank me", said Pat. "Thank the Greendale Knights!"</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Postmn Pat and the Go-Kart Race.</h3>
    <p>Mrs Goggins told everyone about the Greendale go-kart race.She explained the rules. "You must make your own go-kart. You can push,pull or pedalit. But you can't use an engine". Pat,PC Selby,Ajay and Alf got busy making their karts. But things didn't go too well!</p>
    <p>First,Pat's kart rattled,shook,then fell apart ...</p>
